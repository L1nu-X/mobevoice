#COMMISSION_TITLE#

You just recieved a $#COMMISSION_VALUE# micro-endorsement commission #FROM# because they either recharged money into their account or transferred some of their endorsement fees into phone credits.  
You can redeem this credit in seven days for free calling credit or request it be sent to  you as a check after 90 days.


You will receive recurring micro-endorsement commissions , from this person and on all future transactions from the people  you add, so add more and more people. 
Zenofon has great rates now, especially to Brazil and Mexico, so if you have friends who call there, please tell them how great Zenofon is, and show them how to sign up.
