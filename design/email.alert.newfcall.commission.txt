Subject:ZenoFon: #COMMISSION_TITLE# 

Your account was just credited with a  $#COMMISSION_VALUE# micro-endorsement commission because #FROM# made their first Zenofon call.  
They didn't purchase anything.  They just made a test call, yet you still earned credit how great is that!  Probably the easiest money you ever made.
'You can redeem this credit by logging into your account and transferring this new credit it from your commissions account to calling credit in seven days or use it to request a check in 90 days.
If this new member goes on to purchase additional credit from us, or refer another person to Zenofon, you will continue to generate commissions to your account.
To stop these alerts, go to your ZenoFon account page, and change your 'Notifications' settings.
Please refer other people to Zenofon and show your friends how good our service is and how easy it is to generate free credits.  We will be forever grateful.
