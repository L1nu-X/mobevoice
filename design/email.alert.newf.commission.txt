	You just earned a $#COMMISSION_VALUE# registration commission #FROM# from someone who who joined Zenofon using your your direct referral link.
	<br>
When this new Zenophyte makes their first call using Zenofon we will generate another commission for you, and if they continue to buy services from Zenofon, 
you will earn recurring commissions and credits from all their purchases forever.  
	<br>
Also, If they refer other people, you will get commissions from these new people and everyone who joins below them infinitely.  Lets see what this new person can do!
