<h2>About</h2>
<p align="justify">ZenoFon is based in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Now with over 34,000 members and heading towards close to $1 million in annual sales, the company has grown rapidly since its inception four years ago.</p>
<br>
<h2>What we do.</h2>
<p align="justify">It  seems to us that just as the world gets larger in some ways it gets smaller in others. That’s why we thought of Zeno of Elea, the ancient Greek philosopher and an expert on paradoxes, when we named this company. One of today’s greatest challenges for working people with families and friends in different countries around the world is to maintain more relationships across increasingly longer distances. We help our customers stay in tune with the communities that are most important to them no matter how far away they may be.  Closing the gap, saving money, spreading the word!</p>
<br>
<h2>How we got where we are today.</h2>
<p align="justify">Invention. We created a unique product that saves our customers time and money, and then marketed the service through friends and customers only. No paid advertising!</p>
<p align="justify">Today we continue to have extremely limited staff and extremely minimal infrastructure in order to pass the savings on to you and your family and friends. Perhaps most importantly, we focus on thanking the people who endorse us with 900,000 commissions distributed so far.</p>
<br>
<h2>Who we are.</h2>
<strong>Our customers define us. But someone’s got to keep the wheels turning!</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Baruch Herzfeld, President</strong><br>
<p align="justify">Our “man on the street,” chosen by L Magazine to be one of ten "New Yorkers We Love" in their “Heroes and Villains” issue, Baruch has been quoted regularly in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and other major news sources as a social networker, community builder and organizer. Having been in the telecom business for the better part of the last twenty years, Baruch has both a deep understanding of the technical aspects of the phone business as well as the social networks that bring people together.</p>
