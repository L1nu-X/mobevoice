<h2>Who We Are:</h2>
ZenoFon LLC is a startup technology company based out of Brooklyn, NY and Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. Combined, the four founding partners in ZenoFon, have approximately 40 years of experience between them, in the international telecommunications and VoIP industry.<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>ZenoFon's Goals</h2>
Our goals are twofold:<br>
1) To save people money off of their cellphone usage charges to the USA and throughout the world.<br>
2) To spread word of ZenoFon’s services and technologies via a new type of word of mouth referral tracking system.<br>
<br>
<br>

	
<h2>Concepts Explained</h2>
Telephone dial around services:<br>
<br>
Historically, as hard as it is to imagine, there was often only one phone monopoly servicing a geographical area. The whole USA was serviced by one phone company - AT&T, and foreign countries were serviced by government phone monopolies called PTTs. These companies would act aggressively against any form of competition, using any means at their disposal to continue their monopoly over the customer.<br>
<br>
As mobile telephone usage became cheaper and more popular the customer was presented with many more options than just land lines. The cell phone presented the consumer with more options than they had previously. However, cellphone companies typically have low regard for their customers. Once they lock you into a long term contract you are their prisoner until the contractual term is up. ZenoFon intends to remedy this by allowing the customer a choice in choosing to dial around their service provider by allowing them to pick what numbers shows up when they call people or even when they call themselves. We expect this to save you a great deal of money and to even make your dialing experience more streamlined and efficient.<br>
<br>
No longer will the wireless companies have a monopoly on forcing you to dial out with their service and their service only. If you use ZenoFon you finally have a choice that allows you to save money on your monthly cellphone charges even if you increase your usage.<br>
<br>
<br>


<h2>Referral Tracking System</h2>
The best companies on the internet grow without advertising - by word of mouth referrals only. I have never seen advertisements for my favorite websites such as Facebook, Google, Youtube or Pandora. However, people told me about these sites and spread the word about them because they liked the site and were happy to tell their friends about it. ZenoFon would like to try to grow that way, without advertising, by providing such a great service that people spread the word about the company themselves.<br>
<br>
Since we owe the future success of our enterprise to your good wlll, we want to reward you for your positive word of mouth feedback even if you don't purchase our product. We have therefore restricted new users to those who are referred by existing members of ZenoFon. This is the best way for us to track new members back to us the starters of the company. You too will be able to see where your positive word of mouth referrals spread, because you can login to your account and see the twists and turns of how the business spreads throughout America and the world.<br>
<br>
Eventually, if and when we start charging for our service, we will pay out commissions to every refferer along the way. We have designed a commission structure based off of Zeno's Paradox that will allow us to reward people for positive feedback by continuously dividing a base commission number by in half with each person away from yourself. However, since at this time the service is free, we are using the referral system as a tracking method in preparation for the eventuality that we will one day, hopefully, pay out commsssions.<br>
